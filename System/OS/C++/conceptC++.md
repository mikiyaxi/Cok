# Call 
    >> execute a function or line of code, that is a call



# Call by Value
    >> meaning: execute lines of code or function interact with values (variables)
    [!] everytime a value gets called, a copy of that value is created

    ex.
    -----------------------------
    |                           |
    |   void Demo(int i)        |
    |   {                       |
    |     i ++;                 |
    |   }                       |
    |                           |
    |   int main()              |
    |   {                       |
    |     int NUM = 5;          |
    |     Demo(NUM);            |
    |     cout << NUM << endl;  |
    |   }                       |
    |                           |
    -----------------------------
    // NUM won't change, because Demo function make a copy of NUM represented as i inside the function
    // when leaving the function, the copy is gone
    // so NUM in main function won't change, still print out 5

    =============================
    [!]: when program gets larger, function gets more complex, 
         lots of copies will be made, and thus take out lots of memory, and slow down the program



# Reference

    [ some concept ]:

        >> when a value is stored in memory, two things is created
           <1>. the value itself that stored in the memory
           <2>. and its address
           these two are together
 
        >> &: reference operator
        
        >> &a: the address of a
        
        ex.
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        |                                                       |
        |   int a = 5;                                          |
        |   int& ref = a;                                       |
        |                                                       |
        |   cout << a << &a << ref << endl;                     |
        |                                                       |
        |   // we will get 5 for a                              |
        |   // a series of numbers for &a as the address of a   |   
        |   // get 5 for ref                                    |
        |                                                       |

    [ call by reference ]:

        >> reference is just an alias for an existing variable, didn't create new thing


            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            |   int& ref = a    // ref is called the reference, or the alias of a       |
            |   &a              // &a is not called refernece, it is the address of a   |
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------


        >> when calling a function by reference, function will take variables as input
           and passing their address into the function;



    [ pay attention ]:

        + when you are int& ref = 7, is the same as saying a = 7 

        + when you call the funciton, only variable will be created in the memory, reference will not
          it's just an alias
          and I think it will store at different part of the memory aside from where store variable value




    [ dereferencing ]:

        >> passing the address of a variable to a function
           this function then could modify the value stored on that address directlty


# Pointer

    [ defintion ]:

        >> pointers are variables that store the address of a value (a series of number ≈ 12?)


    [ v.s. call by value ]:
       
       >> the difference compare to call by value is that it will modify the value at certain address directly
       >> so not copy of the value is made, free some memory

           • so that you can find where this class is stored in the memory
           • is the same as the "self" when you declaring classes in python

        >> in the ex). below, when you *this.x, you are accessing the value store in the data member x

# Polymorphism


    >> The ability to associate multiple meanings to one function name by means of late binding


    [ late binding ]: 后期绑定

        + definition --> associated it later in the time

        + for example, 

            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            | <1>. you have a class named people in the school                                          |
            | <2>. you have derived classes students, teachers, director, etc                           |
            | <3>. they all could have a method call goToWork()                                         |
            |      but it's not necessary that we need to define them everytime in each child class     |
            | <4>. a good way is it only defined in the base class, and every child can call goToWork() |
            | <5>. when different classes call goToWork(), they behave differently                      |
            | <6>. teacher go to teach, student go to study, ...etc                                     |
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    [ virtual function ]:

        + we can achieve that by making the "goToWork()" function virtual 

        + late (dynamic) binding <官方定义>

            • [place virtual keyword in base class definition, not implementation]
                
                - this tells the compiler to wait until runtime to determine the implemetation of the function,
                  based on the object that calls it

                - if there is a derived class with a redefined version of the function,
                  it will use that version instead of the original

        ex.
        -------------------------------------
        // refer to above inheritance example
        -------------------------------------


        + why not make all functions virtual? - Efficiency

            - The compiler and run-time environment need to do more work to handle virtual function. 
            - using keyword virtual only when necessary


        + slicing problem

            <1>. extended type: children type is also a parent type logicially, and it's true in C++

            <2>. you can extend the type like the following example, but after doing that, 
                 vSpecies could no access to the member in Human class, because Species type doesn't have that

                ex.
                -------------------------------------------------
                |                                               |
                |   vHuman.name = "human";                      |
                |   // extend type                              |
                |   vSpecies = vHuman;                          |
                |   // assume string name is a public variable  |
                |   // cannot do this: vSpecies.name            |
                |                                               |
                -------------------------------------------------



            <3>. to overcome this, use pointer: treat Speices as Human, refering to the following example

                ex.
                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                |                                                                                  |
                |   Species* pS;                                                                   |
                |   Human* pH;                                                                     |

                |   // use -> instread of dot(.) for accessing all members                         |
                |   pH = new Human;                                                                |

                |   pH->printType();                                                               |
                |                                                                                  |
                |   pS = pH;                                                                       |
                |   pS->printType()  // here we are using the overidden function in Human class    |
                |                                                                                  |

# Overloading Operators

# I/O stream

    [ concept ]:

        -----------------------
        #include <iostream>     // iostream is a class, you include it

        + this class has two derived class: istream and ostream
        + each of derived class has its own instance

        >> cout

            • cout is a built-in instance of ostream class
            • << insertion operator only works with ostream object, so that's why only "cout <<" can print

        >> cin
            
            • same for cin, cin is an instance of istream
            • therefore only "cin >>" can take input

    [ istream ]:
        
        friend istream& opeator >>(istream& ins, Operation& o);
        <1>. ins pass by reference as an istream type
        <2>. therefore we can declaring ins is also an istream data type, then we can use >> to it
        <3>. and we need pass by refernece for return type
             because the object we are returning is also pass in by reference - istream& -

    [ ostream ]:

        same with explanation above

    // when you call this function
    // the input needed to pass to the function is "cout" --> like this backaccount.output(cout);




# Const (parameter modifier)

    [ at Front ]:

        >> produce error when you attempt to change the parameter
            + remember that when call by value is used, a copy of the variable will be made
            + and as the program grow later, calculation becomes complex, copies increase 
            + which will take out memory and will slow down the program

    
        // here we don't want amount1 and amount2 to change, these two are class objects
        >> Money add(const Money& amount1, const Money& amount2);
    

    [ At the End ]:

        >> void output(ostream& outs) const;
            + this means that, if we have class object m1(from Money class), and we use m1.output(). 
            + The const in the end of output function means that this function will not modify m1
            + for example, there will be private data that is associated with m1, and we don't want them to change
    
            => so it becomes a read-only function

            <1>. function template definitions can be placed in one file and included in another file with #include
                 (just like class)

            <2>. some compiler do not support

            <3>. can't use swapValue with a class that does not have a working or proper assignment operator

            <4>. can't pass in any arrays to swapValues, since assignment does not work with array types
