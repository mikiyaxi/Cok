    >> how to convert base 10 number into binary or other base number?

      usually, first convert to binary, then to other base
      [ex.] 
      3(10) to base 4
      to binary: 0011
      base 4 is at most 3 ={0, 1, 2, 3}
      "0011" is in the range 3
      
      [ex.]
      4(10) to base 4
      to binary: 0100
      to base 4: 10
      [?]
      for example binary for 0100 is: 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0  
      then when you are working with base 4: 1*4^1 + 0 *4^0

      - least significant bit: The rightmost bit (has the most weighted)
      - most significant bit:  The leftmost bit 
      [!] of a word 32 bits, what the is leftmost bit numbered? 
        + it's 31, because it starts at zero(0)



# Unsinged numbers
    >> what is the largest base ten number representable in 4 bits
    : 4 bits (0000)
    : largest (1111)
    : convert to base 10 --> 15

    >> what is the largest base 10 number representable in 8 bits?
    : 2^8 - 1 = 255
    : 11111111
    : 2^(numbers of bits) - 1



# IMPORTANT FACT!
    >> unsigned 
      + largest:  2^n - 1
      + smallest: 0
      [ex.] 
      1111 = 8+4+2+1 = 15
      [reason.]
      the reason why you need the minus one is because the calculation start at 2^0, 
      so when you 4 digits, n = 4, then you are calculating only up to 2^3


    >> signed 
      + largest:  2^(n-1) - 1
      + smallest: -2^(n-1) 
      [ex.] 
      1000 -(two's complement)-> 1000 --> -8
      [reason]
      the reason minus one inside n is because sign number seperate + and -, one group into two


    >> normal process of calcualting two's complement
      step 1. reverse all 0->1 or 1->0
      step 2. plus 1 on binary scale
      reminder. when you use shortcut, 
      you will find sometime there's not 1 for you to flip or when you come across 1 is already the end, so use the normal process



# Two's complement
    >> occur when number need to be separated by positive and negative (signed number)
    >> signed number representation where a leading 0 indicates positive number, a leading 1 indicates a negative number.
    : how to calcualte?
      + The complement of a value is obtained by complementing each bit(0 -> 1 or i -> 0), 
        and then adding one to the result 

    [!]
    >> All computers use two's complement. sign and magnitude representation was tried in early computers, 
       but was difficult to implement efficiently in hardware
    >> and the existing of both positive and negative 0 is problematic


    [!] 
    Knowing the 2^31 is 2,147,483,648 and so what is the base 10 value of the following two's complement number?
    1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = -2,147,483,648

    [explanation]
    The leftmost bit is multiplied by -2^31, 
    then added with the remaining bits that are multiplied by those bits' usual positive base values. 
    Because those remaining bits are all 0's, the base ten value is just -2,147,483,648 + 0 = -2,147,483,648.

    [!]
    In the two's complement representation, 
    the magnitude of the largest negative value is one greater than the magnitude of the largest positive number

    [ex.]
    for an 8-bit two's complement representation
    >> the most negative value is -128(10000000)    --> all number after leftmost one, follows the normal converation, 
       if (signed number 10000001), then result is -127
    >> the most positive value is 127(01111111)
    >> leftmost is used for representing positive and negative, as well as magnitude 


    [!] compute two's complement

    [positive]
    step 1. 0000 -(reverse)-> 1111
    step 2. 1111 + 1 = 10000
    step 3. keep it inside range, therefore 0000

    [negative]
    step 1. 1111 -(reverse)-> 0000
    step 2. 0000 + 1 = 0001
    step 3. within the ragne, therefore 0001

    >> adding two positive number has a chance to create overflow                 0111 + 0001 = 1000 (-8)
    >> adding two negative number has a chance to create overflow as well         1000 + 1111 = [1]0111 (7)
    >> adding one positive and one negative will cannot overflow

    [practice]
    1011 + 1110 overflow? 
    no, because [1]1001, leftmost 1 will automactically removed, and left with 1001,
    which is negative. 1000 is -8, +1 at the rightmost, so -7 correct

    >> PC (Program Counter)

        + it goes through instruction location/address one by one sequentially

        + that's why it has a operation of adding 4 at the begining (adding 4 move to next address in memory)

        + such each time adding 4 is a convention for next move

        + after loading the next address, find the commands in there


    >> Instruction Memory

        + read the instruction address, and decode it

        + give the instruction out

        + determine what to do for the next register


    >> register table

        + arithmetic operation usually goes to read register first
            • the contents at the address in RAM is sent out as Read Data

        + load word
            • loading value to memory from register table
            • go to Write register
            • finally pass to Data memory
            • output of Data memory is switched back to the write data(input) of the register set by the write register

    
    >> Sign-extend
    


    >> Mux

        + so you have different line (track) connect together, let's say three path, which one goes through this time? 


            Multiplexers decide => output of Data memory is switched back to the write data(input) of the register set

        <5>. ALU seems always required




# Clock (keep the pace)

    >> Frequency = 1/TimePeriod
        + 1 cycle per second = Hertz

    >> to run computer faster
        + reduce the TimePeriod = Increase the Freq


    >> There is a lot more than just CPU speed(frequency) that affects performance

        + clock design
            •
            •
            •

        + why having clock?
            • want predictable values




# Performance

    >> Von Neumann Bottleneck
        + A machine will run only as fast as the slowest operation 

    
    >> Issue
        + Longest delay determines clock period 
            • critical path: load instruction
            • instruction memory -> register file -> ALU -> data memory -> register file

        + no feasible to vary period for different instructions

        + violates design principle 

    >> pipeline(ing)

        + improve performance

        + pipelined laundry: overloapping execution - parallelism
            (refer to p75-9 on the PPT)


        + MIPS pipeline

    >> Hazard

        + Structure hazards
            • a required resource is busy

        + Data hazard
            • need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write

        + Control hazard
            • deciding on control action depends on previous instruction



    >> summary
        
        + Pipelining improves performance by increasing instruction throughput(吞吐量)
            • executing multiple instructions in parallel
            • each instruction has the same latency

        + Subject to hazards
            • Structure
            • data
            • control

        + Instruction set design affects complexity of pipeline implementation
            



# Still want to go faster (Components Affecting Performance)

    >> Limits of single Processor
        + more CPUs (x)
        + many reason for not working out, for example, no way to use all the CPUs

    >> Largest Reason for Multi-processor design failure
        
        + Applications
            • application were traditionally written for serial computation

        + Compiler to split code automatically, which is still not available
            • Software engineers still specify separable 'threads'

        + Operating System control
            • having a Ferrari...without a steering wheel


    >> cache memory 
        
        + inter-station that keep the history of virtual -> physical address look-up record, 
          so that next time looking for same address mapping is faster



    
    >> virtual memory (!)

        <1> When program is running, they reside in memory and occupy certain amount of memory
        <2> programm itself(as if they could think), think it is the only one running on memory 
            --> have a tendency to use up certain amount of memory
        <3> Every program CANNOT have all memory, which itself may be limited
        <4> how can program 'share' without knowing it is sharing


    >> Memory Management Unit (MMU)

        < 1 >. metaphor: at first, program look its spot in the physical memory address itself, 
               it doesn't how to effectively manage its spot, so does other program
        

        < 2 >. MMU is the door keeper, it arranges all programs to make use of all physical memory address


        < 3 >. they can't communicate like human, program doesn't aware the existence of MMU or the remaining space left, 
               they just find continguous spots and sit in

               + when program suit themselves in the memory address, order exist.
               + some finsih runing faster, some slower
               + when one is finish, it leaves, and empty out the space for another program
               + but other program might have size little smaller, but necessary fill in the whole empty, 
                 then there will be a gap left out
               + this gap is small that no new program has this size could fit in, 
                 but current running program is no using it as well

               ------> memory fragmentation <-------


        < 4 >. virtual address is created, here the word "virtual" holds its meaning just in terms of programs. To programs, 
               those address is virtual, but they don't know

        
        < 5 >. program find the assume they find the continguous spots and suit in, 
               but in reality those space might map separately to physical address by MMU


        < 6 >. there are different ways of managing space or slice the space, that is up to MMU


        < 7 >. when many programs is running together, there is a page table 

                + 4k for each page size
                + think of that each page contains list of mapping
                + and right now you have a book of page

                [!]: if some mapping is in the middle of the page, 
                     a way of mapping is to map the first 4k of program to the actual physical address, 
                     and let the rest map to the middle of the page


        + converts (mapping) requested address to a real, physical address
        |
        V
        + so that every program 'thinks' it starts at address zero, and owns all the memory
        |
        V
        + The MMU keeps a table to keep track of the proper locations

        [ ! ]: 
        1. therefore not contiguous blocks is required
        2. can handle spitting program #1s memory over several areas
        3. like a sandwiches style
