# Basic Concepts

### Software Engineering 
```
A disciplined approach to the design, production, and maintenance of computer programs
```

### Abstraction
```
[Abstraction]: a model of a complex system that includes only the essential details
[Information Hiding]: simplify work by hiding complex details

- Programs are abstractions -
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[.h]    file explains how the class work, what functionalities and properties it has
[.cpp]  detailed implementations of how each function/properties works
```

### Functional Decomposition v.s Object-oriented Design
```
[1] functional decomposition 
     >> breaks the program into functions 
     >> these functions form a complete solution to the problem when used together

[2] Object-oriented Design 
     • Divide-and-Conquer: break down the program into things instead of tasks
     • The design consists of objects, which are defined by classes
     • Objects combine data and operations
```
```
[Quote]

Grady Booch, "what Is and Isn't Object Oriented Design", 1989
-------------------------------------------------------------
"Read the specification of the software you want to build. 
 Underline the verbs if you are after procedural code, 
 the nouns if you aim for an object-oriented program."
```

### BUG
```
[1] Compile-Time Errors
     • unclean
     • syntactically incorrect
     • know your programming language, editor, etc

[2] Run-Time Errors
     • errors occur during execution after successfully compiled, refer to BUG we called
     • (Robustness): the ability of a program to recover from an error 
     • often found with sufficient testing
        1) logical error
        2) Input/Output error
        3) undefined object error
        4) division by zero error
        5) etc
```

### TEST 
```
[1] Program Verification
     • checking if a program fulfills specification: "Are we doing the job right?"

[2] Program Validation
     • checking if the program fulfills its intended purpose: "Are we doing the right job?"

[3] Precondition
     • a condition that must be true before an operation is exexuted

[4] Postcondition
     • a condition that will be true after an operation completes

[5] Exceptions
     • allow programs to interrupt normal control flow to handle exceptional situations
     • handling them should be part of the design
```

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)
```
+ we are talking about "nouns", not "verb"

Data 
• representation of information 
  in a manner suitable for communication or analysis by humans or machines

Data are nouns of the programming world
• The objects that are manipulated
• The information that is processed

Definition 
• A data type whose (logical) properties (domain and operations) 
  are specified independently of any particular implementation.
```

### Different views of ADT 

#### [+] Logical Level
```
abstract view of the domain and operations
```
#### [+] Implementation Level
```
specific representation to "hold" the data items, and implementation of operations
```
#### [+] Application Level
```
modeling real-life data in a specific context, also known as user level
```
#### [+] Ex: ADT List
```
(Application Level) 
  : modeling real-life list, a homogeneous collection of elements with a linear relation
  => there is one first element 
  => every element except first one has a unique predecessor
  => every element except last one has a unique successor

(Logical Level)
  => domain: data that resembles private data, or struct that defined in .h/.cpp file
  => operations supported: PutItem(), GetItem(), DeleteItem(), GetNext(), ...

(Implementation Level)
  : implemented using array, linked list, or others; codes for operations
```

#### [+] Library Example
```
[1] Application Level: Public Library that you can make the use of 

[2] Logical Level: 
     > domain is a collection of books; 
     > operations inclues, check book out, check book in, pay fine, reserve a book

[3] Implementation Level:
     > representation of the structure to hold "books", and the coding for operations
```

### ADT operations
```
• Constructor: creates a new instance (object) of an ADT

• Transformer (setter): changes state of the data values of an instance

• Observer (getter): observe the state of the data values without changing them

• Iterator (loop): allows us to process all the components in a data structure sequentially
```
### C++ Data Types

#### [+] Simple
```
[1] Integral (完整的)
     > char
     > short
     > int 
     > long
     > enum

[2] Floating (有小数点)
     > float 
     > double
     > long 
     > double

[3] Address 
     > pointer 
     > reference 
```
#### [+] Composite
```
[1] Definition 
     : stores a collection of individual data components under *one variable name*,
       allows individual components to be accessed

[2] Type 
     > array 
     > struct 
     > union 
     > class 
```

### Unstructured v.s Structured data types
#### [+] Unstructured 
```
components are [not] organized with respect to one another
e.g. strcut and classes
```
#### [+] Structured 
```
organization of components determines method used to access individual components
e.g. arrays
```


### Pass-by-value v.s pass-by-reference
#### [+] Pass by value
```
    sending a copy of the contents of the actual argument
    -----------------               -------------------
    |               |    a copy     |                 |
    | calling block | ------------> | Function Called |
    |               |               |                 |
    -----------------               -------------------
    so, actual argument cannot be changed by the function 
```

#### [+] Pass by reference (&)
```
 sends the location (memory address) of the actual argument 
    -----------------                -------------------
    |               |    location    |                 |
    | calling block | -------------> | Function Called |
    |               |                |                 |
    -----------------                -------------------
  function access actual argument itself (not just a copy)
```
### Typedef definition
```
typedef: 

[1] Is a reserved keyword in the programming languages C and C++
[2] It is used to create an additional name (alias) for another data type
[3] It is often used to simlify the syntax of complex data structure (struct/class)
[4] used to provide specific descriptive type names for integer data type of varying sizes
     > int
     > double 
     > long
     > ...

[ex]. 
const int NUM_DEPTS = 5;
const int NUM_MONTHS = 12;
const int NUM_STORES = 3;
typedef long MonthlySalesType [NUM_DEPTS] [NUM_MONTHS] [NUM_STORES];
MonthlySalesType monthSales;

=> here MonthlySales is a 3 dimensonal array that could hold up to 5*12*3 amount of value
=> so it's also a alias of basic type long


                -------------------------------------------------
                |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |///|  <- monthlySales[0][11][2]
            ----------------------------------------------------|
            |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  
  ---   ----------------------------------------------------|---|
   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |    |-----------------------------------------------|---|---|
   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        |-----------------------------------------------|---|---|
   5    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  rows  |-----------------------------------------------|---|----    ---
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |        /
   |    |-----------------------------------------------|----   3 widths
   |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |          /
  ---   -------------------------------------------------        ---

        | ----------------- 12 columns -----------------|
```
### Namespaces
```
• Definition: 
  >> In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and 
     refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of 
     objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

• Example:
  namespace mySpace
  {
      // all variables and functions within this block must be accessed using 
      // scope resolution operator (::) for avoiding namespace pollution
  }

• Three ways to access members within a Namespace 
    + Qualify each reference:
        > mySpace::name with every reference 
    
    + Using declaration:
        > using mySpace::name;
        ( All future references to name refer to mySpace::name )

    + Using directive:
        > using namespace mySpace;
        ( All members of mySpace can be referenced without qualification )
```

### Scope of variables
```
-------------------------
| Type: local & global  |
-------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ex].
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int global = 5;                 // global variable 

int func() 
{
    int local = 3;              // local variable 
    int global = 10;            // local variable with same name as the global variable
    
    cout << global << endl;     // 10 compiler will assign global to 10 because run in lines
    cout << ::global << endl;   // 5  the way of accessing global varibles in local ::
    cout << local << endl;  ;   // 3  local variable
}

int main() 
{
    cout << local << endl;      // can't access out of where local variables is defined
}

```

### Structs (alias: records)
**definition**
```
1) another way of creating abstract data type, just like class but by default everything is public 
2) usually used with class

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ex].

struct NameType {
   char first[15];
   char middleInit;
   char last[15];
};

struct StudentType {
   NameType name;               // any structure can be a member of a struct 
   int      idNum;
   float    credits;
   float*    gpa;
};
StudentType student1,student2;  
student1.name.last;             // accessing struct member using dot(.)
student2.name.first[0];         // accessing struct member that is an array
student2->gpa                   // if it is a pointer, accessing the value with ->
```


# Array
```
In C++, array cannot be assigned one to another

[ex]. 
{
    int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int arr2[3];

    arr2 = arr1
}
output[1] error: array type 'int[3]' is not assignable

------------------------------------------------------

nor can be the return type of a function in C++

[ex].
output[2] error: array type cannot be return 
```

### One-dimensional Array
```
C++ array elements are stored in a contiguous memory block with a base address

float values[5];      // assume 4 bytes for float

Base address (lowest address) 
    |
    |       
    ------->    7000        7004        7008        7012        7016
            -------------------------------------------------------------
            |           |           |           |           |           |
            -------------------------------------------------------------
              values[0]   values[1]   values[2]   values[3]   values[4]

    Address of values[index]?
    = Address(index) = BaseAddress + (The number of)Index * SizeOfElement

```


### Two-dimensional Array
```
[1] A two-dimensional array is a structured composite data type made up of a finite, 
     fixed size collection of homogeneous elements having relative positions given 
     by a pair of indexes and to which there is direct access


[2] Array operation (creation, storing values, retrieving values) are performed
     using a declaration and a "a pair of indexes(row & column)" representing
     the component's position in each dimension


• Mental Presentation

        const int NUM_STATES = 50;
        const int NUM_MONTHS = 12;
        int statHighh [NUM_STATES][NUM_MONTHS];
                          rows       columns


                 [0]         [1]                    [10]         [11]
            -------------------------------------------------------------
        [0] |           |           |  .......  |           |           |
            -------------------------------------------------------------
            -------------------------------------------------------------
        [1] |           |           |  .......  |           |           |
            -------------------------------------------------------------
                                          .
                                          .
                                          .
            -------------------------------------------------------------
       [49] |           |           |  .......  |           |           |
            -------------------------------------------------------------

• In Storage
    
        In memory, C++ stores 2D arrays in row order;
        The first row is followed by the second rows, etc.

            8000                8024                8048
            -------------------------------------------------------------
            |   |   |...|   |   |   |   |...|   |   |   |   |...|   |   |
            -------------------------------------------------------------
            | ----------------- | ----------------- |
           12 highs for state 0 | 12 highs for state 1      etc.
            Alabama (first row) | Alaska (second row)
```

### Element address calculation based on a given base address
```
According to the above example
Based Address 8000 
=> to locate an element such as stateHighs[2][7] 
=> the compiler needs to know that there are 12 columns in this two-dimensional array

so, baseAddress + (2*12 + 7) * 2 
--------------------------------
row index = 2, so pass through first(index=0) and second(index=1) row (together 24 spots)
column index = 7, the 7th spot in the third row(index=2)
assume 2 bytes for type int, memory address is located with bytes
```
### Passing arrays as function parameters
```
[1] In C++, arrays are always passed by reference, 
     and & is not used with formal parameter type
     Meaning, always pass the base address of an array to function, 
     and function can modify array

[2] protect array from unintentional changes by using "const" in formal parameter 
     and function prototype
```
#### [+] One Dimensonal Array
##### &#x266f; incorrect way
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// Note that arr[] for fun is just a pointer 
// even if square brackets are used
void fun(int arr[])                                 
{
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    cout << "\nArray size inside fun() is " << n;
}
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    cout << "Array size inside main() is " << n;
    fun(arr);
    return 0;
}

output[1]: 
Array size inside main() is 8
Array size inside fun() is 2
------------------------------------------------
explain: when passing int arr to fun() in main, it is always treated as a pointer
         so the calculation in fun() will mess up with the sizeof() function
         you can't the correct size of a pointer 
         the solution is passing the size as a parameter to the main as well
```
##### &#x266f; [correct way](./basic/Array/1DArray.cpp)

#### [+] Two Dimensonal Array
##### &#x266f; [methods](./basic/Array/2DArray.cpp)


# Object-Oriented Programming
```
• Three inter-related constructs: classess, objects and inheritance 
  
[1] Objects are basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system 
[2] A class defines the structure of its objects 
[3] Classes are organized in an "is-a" hierarchy defined by inheritance
```
### Abstraction 
```
[.h]        file -> known as header file, data member and member function specification 
[.cpp]      file -> member function implementation 
[main.cpp]  file -> objects being used in here
```
### Inheritance
```
+ Allows programmers to create a new class that is a specialization of an existing class 

    => new class is called a derived class of the existing class 
    => the existing class is the base class of the new class
```
### Polymorphism
```
+ The ability to associate multiple meanings to one function name by means of late binding

+ [late binding]: associated it later in the time 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| <1>. you have a class named people in the school                                          |
| <2>. you have derived classes students, teachers, director, etc                           |
| <3>. they all could have a method call goToWork()                                         |
|      but it's not necessary that we need to define them everytime in each child class     |
| <4>. a good way is it only defined in the base class, and every child can call goToWork() |
| <5>. when different classes call goToWork(), they behave differently                      |
| <6>. teacher go to teach, student go to study, ...etc                                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ [ virtual function ]:

    => we can achieve that by making the "goToWork()" function virtual 
    => late (dynamic) binding <官方定义>

    ex).
    [ place virtual keyword in base class definition, not implementation ]
            
        § this tells the compiler to wait until runtime 
          then to determine the implemetation of the function 
          based on the object that calls it

        § if there is a derived class with a redefined version of the function 
          it will use that version instead of the original

```
### Composition

```
refer to below
```
# Error & Exception Management
### Define your own [Exception](http://peterforgacs.github.io/2017/06/25/Custom-C-Exceptions-For-Beginners/) 
```
Exception could be an user-defined class
```
### Try/throw/catch
**[pre-defined exception](./basic/Exception/preDefined.cpp)**
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class demoDemo {};                                  // this also works

class demo {                                        // create a class
public:
    void throwError();
};
 
void demo::throwError()                             // define a member function in the class
{
    cout << "My Exception Happens" << endl;
}

int main()
{
    try {
        throw demo();
    }
 
    catch (demo d) {                                // catch a class object d
        d.throwError();                             // execute d's method.throwError()
    }
}
```


# Algorithm
##### &#x266f; [algorithm section](../algorithm/basicAlgorithm.md)
```
1. A logical sequence of discrete steps 
2. steps that describe a complete solution to a problem
3. computable in a finite amount of time (meaning it will terminate)
```
### Analysis of algorithm
```
The theoretical study of design and analysis of computer algorithms, not about programming
```
#### [+] Design
```
[1] design correct algorithms which minimize cost
[2] efficiency is the design criterion
```
#### [+] Analysis
```
+ predict the cost of an algorithm in terms of resource and performance
```
#### [+] Basic Goals for designing
```
[1] always correct
[2] always terminates
[3] always care about performance
```
#### [+] WHY?
```
Computers are always limited in the computational ability and memory
+ Resources are always limited
+ Efficiency is the center of algorithms
```
#### [+] Growth Rate 
##### &#x266f; Example 1 
```
[Question]: 
determine whether x is one of A[1], A[2],..., A[n], and retrieve information about x.

[Algorithm]: 
go through each number in order and compare it to x 

[pseudocode]:
i = 1;
while  (i <= n) and (A[i] != x) do
i = i + 1;
if (i > n) then i = 0;

[related questions]:
<1> Number of element comparisons?     --> from 1 to n
<2> Worst case?                        --> n
<3> Best case?                         --> 1

```
##### &#x266f; explain
```
further abstraction we use in algorithm analysis is to characterize in terms of growth 

[1] Matrix multiplication time grows as n^3 
[2] Linear search time grows as n 

[why is it important?]
input size   |    n    |   nlgn   |   n^2   |   n^3   |   2^n   |
    10       | 0.00001 |   ....   |   ...   |  0.001  |  < 0.01 |   => unit: sec
    100      | 0.0001  |   ....   |   ...   |  1 min  |    ∞    |
    1000     | 0.001   |   ....   |   ...   |  17.64  |    ∞    |   => unit: min
    10000    | 0.01    |   ....   |   ...   |  11.76  |    ∞    |   => unit: days
```

### Comparison of algorithm
```
[Goal]: Compare the efficiency of different algorithm, efficiency is what matters!
```
#### [!] One problem Two Algorithm
```
[problem]: Calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to N, i.e. 1+2+3+...+(N-1)+N 

[Alg #1]:                           --> performs N addition/assignment operations 
sum = 0;
for (count=1; count<=N; count++)
     sum = sum + count;

[Alg #2]:                           --> one addition, one multiplication and one division
sum = (1+N)*(N/2);
```
#### [+] How to compare ?
```
[1] Compare the actual running time on a computer 
[2] Compare the number instructions/statements executed
     a) varies with languages used and programmer's style 
     b) count the number of passes through a "critical loop" in algorithm 
[3] Count representative operations performed in the algorithm
```
# Pointers
```
A pointer variable contains the memory address of another variable 

[for what]: for indirect addressing of data and for dynamic allocation of memory 
```
### Declaration
```
use an aterisk(*)
-----------------
int* intPointer;
```
### Manipulation (operation)
```
// ampersand(&) returns the address of a variable
int alpha = 10;
int* intPointer = &alpha;                       // return a address like this: 0x16ba0f49c

// accessing variables value through pointer 
*intPointer = 25;                               // alpha is now 25
```
### Pointer Ex).
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int* intPtr_1 = new int;                // pointer of a single int value
    int* intPtr_2 = new int [10];           // pointer of an array of int
    int** intPtr_3 = new int* [10];         // pointer of an array of int pointers

    cout << *intPtr_1 << endl;              // since intPtr is an address
                                            // to access the value stored on this address
                                            // use asterisk: *(0x600003260040) = 0
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        cout << intPtr_2[i] << endl;        // other way of print element: *(intPtr_2+i)
    }                                       // all are int values on the following address
                                            // * = [] here I guess equivalent to below
                                            // *(0x600003260040+i) = 0x600003260040[i]
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        cout << intPtr_3[i] << endl;        // all are int pointers on the following address
    }

    // deletion
    delete intPtr_1;                        // deleting the value on that pointer address
    delete [] intPtr_2;                     // same 
    delete [] intPtr_3;                     // same

    return 0;
}
```
# Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Memory Allocation
#### [+] Static Memory allocation
```
(when): compile time
allocates a fixed amount of memory during compile time, pre-specify in declaration 
```
#### [+] Dynamic memory allocation 
```
(when): runtime
Allocation of memory space for a variable at run time, as opposed to static one

(where):
Dynamic allocation creates variables on heap (or free store),
a section of memory reserved for dynamic allocation
```
### Use cases
Dynamic allocation uses the keyword **new**
```
int* ptr = new int;
// new returns a pointer to the newly allocated int on the heap
// and the value can only be accessed via this pointer

(new):
      • pointers can point to nothing using NULL 
      • if no memory is available on the heap, new operator returns NULL (for check memory)
```
### Memory Leak Issue
```
A memory leak is the loss of available memory space 
that occurs when some "dynamically" allocated memory is never deallocated, called garbage
```
#### [+] Ex).
```
float* money = new float;
*money = 33.46;
float* myMoney = new float;
```
<img src="./pic/memoryLeak1.png" width=200>
<br>

```
•myMoney = *money;                  // set the value of myMoney = the value of money
```
<img src="./pic/memoryLeak2.png" width=200>
<br>

```
myMoney = money;                    // set the memory address of myMoney = money's
```
<img src="./pic/memoryLeak3.png" width=200>
<br>

```
The memory cell originally used by myMoney is now inaccessible.
Since there's no way to collect the garbage, it is small memory leak
```
#### [+] Delete Operation 
```
[1] If it is single variables 
     >> delete myMoney;              // safely clean up the memory allocated to myMoney

[2] If it is array variables
     >> delete [] myArray;           // deleting array
```
# List (in C++)
**a collection of homogeneous items**


### Linked List 

#### [+] Circular Linked List
#### [+] Reverse Linked List

### Unsorted list
#### [+] Array based 
##### &#x266f; static & dynamic (refer to [SortedType](./basic/List/))
```
The length field must be present in order to define the extent of the list within the array

• differences 
1) GetItem() 
    > for SortedType you can use binary search, 
    > but for UnsortedType you had to loop through whole list
2) PutItem()
    > SortedType had to maintain the order, after find the location for inserting
    > UnsortedType put anywhere that require less computing power
3) DeleteItem()
    > SortedType need to maintain order, move item a space up after deletion
    > UnsortedType can just place the last item to where an item is deleted and decrement length
```
#### [+] Linked-List based
A collection of **node** that are linked toegther by **pointer** in a chain
##### &#x266f; Node
```
[1] basic component of a linked list, store data and a pointer to the next node
[2] Nodes are created when needed using dynamically allocated memory 
[3] The last node in the list has a NULL pointer

1) Only change from unsorted list is guaranteeing list elements are sorted
2) Order is determined by ItemType's CompareTo method 
3) PutItem and DeleteItem pre- and post- condition: list is sorted and remains sorted

##### • Application Level (no changes)
```
1) Nothing has changed for the user, list interface is exactly the same
2) GetNextItem will return the next item in key order
```
##### • Imlementation Level (few changes)

A queue is an ADT in which elements are added to the rear and removed from the front

    QueueType();
    ~QueueType();

    bool IsEmpty() const;
    bool IsFull() const;

    ItemType* items;                // Dynamically allocated array 
    int maxQue;                     // max length 
};

#### [+] Implementation Level
##### &#x266f; Fixed-Front Queue 
```
(no efficient, waste a lots of memory space)
```
<img src="./pic/fixFrontQueue.png">

##### &#x266f; Floating Queue (focus on this)
```
1) more efficiient
2) when rear is the indeed the last item in the queue => wrap around => use modulus(mod %)

// (rear+1) % length, in this case 5
```
<img src="./pic/floatingQueue.png" width=800>

```
3) Issue with set front and rear directly

=> in the following situation, cannot distinguish Empty Queue & Full Queue
```
<img src="./pic/floatingQueueIssue.png" width=500>

```
4) Fix this Issue
----------------------------
Solution [1]: more intuitive
{...count the length...}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution [2]: less intuitive, but cooler and efficient, go with this one
```
<img src="./pic/floatingQueueIssuesFix.png" width=600>

```
[empty queue]:
1) according to figure 1 above, when Dequeue 
2) front += 1 
3) since front is the index before actual front item, front == rear gives empty queue

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[full queue]:
1) according to figure 2 above, when front = 2 while the actual front is at index = 3
2) rear + 1 = front, indicates Full

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// front = index of the array slot "preceding" the front element in the queue
// always reserve this slot to be empty(never store queue element here)
// if we initialize a queue with 100, what we actually use is 99 space
```
#### [+] Application Level
```
// For users simplicity, maxQue = max + 1;
// because by adopting the solution 2, we will have empty space in the queue

# Templates 
```
making a C++ function a template can let it apply to variables of all types 
```
### Ex).
#### [+] without Class 
##### &#x266f; Format 
```
template<class T>

1) class T: T refers to a type you will apply later, can be substitute with typename 
2) T:       just a place holder, you can use any name, but "class" this keyword must be consistent
3) ADT:     

for example.
>> template<class ItemType>
>> template<class COOL>
```
##### &#x266f; Normal Situation 
```
void swapValues(int& variable1, int& variable2)
{
    int temp;
    temp = variable1;
    variable1 = variable2;
    variable2 = temp;
}
```
##### &#x266f; With Template
```
template<class T>
void swapValues(T& variable1, T& variable2)
{
    T temp;
    temp = variable1;
    variable1 = variable2;
    variable2 = temp;
}
```
##### &#x266f; Test Code
```
int main() 
{
    int numOne = 5, numTwo = 3;
    char letterOne = 'a', letterTwo = 'b';

    cout << "Before Swap" << endl;
    cout << "=== num ===" << endl;
    cout << "The first number: " << numOne << " The second number: " << numTwo << endl;
    cout << "=== letter ===" << endl;
    cout << "The first letter: " << letterOne << " The second letter: " << letterTqo << endl;

    // performing swap 
    swapValues(numOne, numTwo);
    swapValues(letterOne, letterTwo);
    cout << " =========================== " << endl;

    cout << "After Swap" << endl;
    cout << "=== num ===" << endl;
    cout << "The first number: " << numOne << " The second number: " << numTwo << endl;
    cout << "=== letter ===" << endl;
    cout << "The first letter: " << letterOne << " The second letter: " << letterTqo << endl;

}
```
#### [+] with Class
##### &#x266f; Format 
```
=> className<dataType> classObject;

|
V
className<int> classObject;
className<string> classObject;
className<ItemType> classObject;
```
##### &#x266f; Normal Situation 
##### &#x266f; With Template 
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>              // class template
class Number {
   private:
    T num;                      // variable of type T

   public:
    Number(T n) : num(n) {}     // constructor

    T getNum()
    {
        return num;
    }
};
```
##### &#x266f; Test Code
```
int main() {

    Number<int> numberInt(7);                            // create object with int type

    Number<double> numberDouble(7.7);                    // create object with double type

    cout << "int Number = " << numberInt.getNum() << endl;
    cout << "double Number = " << numberDouble.getNum() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
##### &#x266f; Template with ADT Class

###### [StackType Example](./basic/Template/Template_Stack.cpp)
```
ex) delcare array with template class, using <> brackets

1). if template<class ItemType>, 
    declaring array with ItemType will be like ItemType<size>;

2). if ADT like class PQType {}, under private data member use class from other library 
    from LTS heap library 
    private:
            HeapType<ItemType> items;

reminder). 

    + inside the HeapType from other library, while in the PQType definition, HeapType also use this template
    + every member function inside PQType class need to have this 
    ------------------ format ------------------
            tempalte<class ItemType>
            PQType<ItemType>::PQType(int max)
            {
                maxItems = max;
                items.elements = new ItemType[max];
                length = 0;
            }

    * template<class ItemType> at the top 
    * <ItemType> before scope resolution
```
